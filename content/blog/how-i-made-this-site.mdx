How I made this site using Next.js, MDX, and how you can do it too.

## Stack used

I had myself running smoothly with React, particularly Next.js - so that's what I used to get this site up and running.

Note that

Following are the core technologies involved

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) - React.js based framework for rapid scaffolding
- [TailwindCss](https://tailwindcss.com) - The styling part to make writing CSS a breeze
- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) - an easy way to integrate markdown with JSX
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com) - to store feedback data

[JSONBIN](https://jsonbin.io) is also used to keep track of the dino love count on the [home page](/).

## Full Disclosure moment

I didn't make this site all by myself from scratch. I just didn't want to do it all again when we have the amazing open source community.

Instead, I used the blog starter templates from GitHub - specifically those which were using Next.js and MDX, because I knew I am comfortable with those.
Also, I tweaked this site a lot to match it with the picture I had in my mind.
## How to get started

I would recommend starting with a starter template or project which is open source, as that helps eliminates the need to write all the basic code and structure from scratch required for your site.

### Get a starter template

Just get a starter template or project.

Following are a few popular ones available - 

- [tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog)
- [Nextjs-blog-boilerplate](https://github.com/ixartz/Next-js-Blog-Boilerplate)
- [Next-js-notion-starter](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/nextjs-notion-starter-kit)

There are literally thousands of these available on [GitHub](https://github.com).

This step will eliminate the need to set up and start a project from scratch.

### Make your tweaks

Understand the project first, know how it all works. Then, start tweaking the components according to your own needs.

Few things you can do - 

- Changing the theme to suit your taste.
- Add in some of your custom components to make it truly yours.
- Change the font

There are endless things we can do to make something better. It all comes down to our imagination.


### Write your blog posts
 
This one is exciting. You get to write your own posts  ðŸ¤©. 

Head over to the `posts` folder or directory, `content` in my case, and start writing your own blog posts.

### Get a domain and host it

The last is to purchase a domain name, like I did [codejerk.xyz](https://codejerk.xyz). Or use the one you already own.

Host your site with a reputable and recognizable hosting service. I deployed this site with [Vercel](https://vercel.com) because it is the easiest way to deploy a Next.js app.

## Final thoughts

I know I haven't demonstrated anything in this post with code and images. That's because this is meant to be a guide for those who want to get an overview of how things work.
