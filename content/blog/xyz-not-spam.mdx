I could use any domain of my choice. The most popular <b>.com</b> or <b>.io</b> but I didn't. 

Here's why.

## .xyz is a top-level domain

<b>.xyz is a top-level domain.</b>

Most people may not even be aware of this fact and they are right, kinda. Most people have come across spam sites on the internet and they use .xyz.
This has decreased the trust in people and the moment someone comes across a .xyz, they fear opening or visiting it.

.xyz is a top-level domain and works just like .com or any other top-level domains out there.

## Why use .xyz

I always wondered about the .xyz domain, it looks weird, sounds weird and it feels like it was just made for fun.

So I researched a bit on it, read some great articles online and guess what, it blew my mind ðŸ¤¯. 

Google's parent company Alphabet uses .xyz. Here ðŸ‘‰ [abc.xyz](https://abc.xyz).

Another one is [starship.xyz](https://starship.xyz), launched in 2014 by skype's co-founders.

These were enough reasons for me to get myself a .xyz domain. I wanted the domain to be funky, just look at the name. With the .xyz, this is perfect for me.
