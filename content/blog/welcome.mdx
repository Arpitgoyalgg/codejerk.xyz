Hello! Welcome to my personal space on the internet. I'm so happy that I was finally able to launch this site for everyone to see.

## Hello World

My name is Arpit Goyal. I am an undergrad student in India and a <b>web developer</b>.

I also achieved the <b>AWS cloud practitioner certificate</b> this year(2022).

More about me [here](/about).


## Why this site?

I always wondered how would it feel to be on the internet, especially a place you can call yours. Guess this is it.
I got inspired when I came across [Flavio Copes](https://www.flaviocopes.com). In one of his blogs, he said that anyone can do a blog site. That got me.

## Tech Stack used in this website

- Next.js <TbBrandNextjs className="inline"/>
- Supabase <SiSupabase className="inline" />
- JSONBIN <VscJson className="inline" />

These are just the main technologies used in the making of this website.
